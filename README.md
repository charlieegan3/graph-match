# graph-match

A library for matching patterns in graphs.

## Graph Assumptions
This project has been written for a tool that I'm working on where it's possible to make a number of assumptions on the type of graphs used. I'm working with dependency parse graphs and have made the following assumptions:

* Graphs are directed
* Graphs are acyclic
